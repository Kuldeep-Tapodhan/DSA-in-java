/**
 ‚úÖ Array
 An array is a collection of elements of the same data type.

 It is used to store multiple values in a single variable.

 Access is done using index numbers (e.g., arr[0]).

 Arrays do not define behavior ‚Äî they only hold data.

 Memory is allocated in a contiguous block.

 Arrays are less flexible and primarily used for simple data storage.

 Cannot represent real-world entities directly.

 ‚úÖ Class
 A class is a user-defined blueprint for creating objects.

 It encapsulates data (attributes) and behavior (methods) together.

 A class can have multiple data types as fields.

 Objects of a class access members using dot notation (e.g., obj.name).

 Memory is dynamically allocated for each object.

 Classes are highly flexible, support inheritance, encapsulation, etc.

 Perfect for modeling real-world entities like Student, Car, etc.

 üîÅ Summary Statement
 Use an array when you just need to store and access a list of similar items, and use a class when you need to model entities with both data and behavior.
